1 Question: What movie was first nominated on an Academy Award as a korean film and who is its director?
Thought 1: I need to search for a korean film that was nominated on an Academy Award, and find its name and director.
Action 1: Search[korean film]
Observation 1: The term "Cinema of Korea" (or "Korean cinema") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.. South Korean films enjoyed a "Golden age" during the late 1950s, and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality. Nonetheless, by 2005 South Korea became a nation that watched more domestic than imported films in theatres[1] due somewhat to laws placing limits on the number of foreign films able to be shown per theatre per year, [2] but mostly due to the growth of the Korean entertainment industry which quadrupled in size during this period.[3] In the theaters, Korean films must be played for 73 days per year since 2006, a similar restriction that exists in countries like the UK and France. On cable TV 25% domestic film quota will be reduced to 20% after KOR-US FTA. It has been noted that Korean movies have consistently outperformed foreign with very few exceptions in the Korean box office.[4]. According to the October 19, 1897 issue of The Times, "Motion pictures have finally been introduced into Joseon, a country located in the Far East. At the beginning of October 1897, motion pictures were screened for the public in Jingogae, Bukchon, in a shabby barrack that was borrowed from its Chinese owner for three days.

Thought 2: I need to search for a specific korean film that was nominated on an Academy Award.
Action 2: Search[korean film nominated on an Academy Award]
Observation 2: Could not find korean film nominated on an Academy Award. Similar: ['Parasite (2019 film)', 'Academy Award for Best Picture', '95th Academy Awards', 'List of South Korean submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film', 'Academy Award for Best International Feature Film'].

Thought 3: I need to search for Parasite (2019 film) since it is the only korean film that was nominated on an Academy Award.
Action 3: Search[Parasite (2019 film)]
Observation 3: Parasite (Korean: 기생충; Hanja: 寄生蟲; RR: Gisaengchung) is a 2019 South Korean thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won and co-produced. The film, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, Park Myung-hoon and Lee Jung-eun, follows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family, infiltrating their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.. The script is based on Bong's source material from a play written in 2013. He later adapted it into a 15-page film draft, and it was split into three different drafts by Han. Bong stated that he was inspired by the 1960 Korean film The Housemaid, and by the Christine and Léa Papin incident in the 1930s. Filming began in May 2018 and finished that September. The project included cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, film editor Yang Jin-mo, and composer Jung Jae-il. Darcy Paquet, an American film critic and author, provided English translations for the film's international release.. Parasite premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2019, where it became the first Korean film to win its top prize, the Palme d'Or. It was released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on 30 May, and was praised for Bong's direction and screenplay, and also for its editing and production design.

Thought 4: Parasite (2019 film) was directed by Bong Joon-ho, so the answer is Parasite (2019 film) and Bong Joon-ho.
